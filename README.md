# Next.js Blank Page Bug

This repository demonstrates a common but frustrating issue in Next.js: a blank page appearing where content should be rendered. The issue often stems from unexpected behavior or misconfigurations within the application, rather than obvious syntax errors.  This example highlights the problem and provides a solution.

## Bug Report

The `pages/index.js` file contains simple code to display a heading. However, when the application is run, the browser only displays a blank page.

## Solution

The solution often involves verifying Next.js's basic setup and ensuring there are no conflicts between your code and Next.js's rendering mechanisms. Sometimes a simple fix can solve the problem, like double-checking the code for any errors and rebuilding the project.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Observe the blank page.
